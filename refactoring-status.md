# Visual Editor Refactoring Status

## Completed Tasks

1. **Created Directory Structure**
   - Created `src/components/TreeView` for the TreeView component
   - Created `src/types` for type definitions
   - Created `src/utils` subdirectories for utility functions

2. **Extracted Components**
   - Moved TreeView component to `src/components/TreeView/index.tsx`

3. **Extracted Type Definitions**
   - Created `src/types/tree.ts` for TreeNode interface
   - Created `src/types/figma.ts` for Figma-related interfaces
   - Created `src/types/variables.ts` for Variable-related interfaces

4. **Extracted Utility Functions**
   - Created `src/utils/colorUtils/index.ts` for color conversion utilities
   - Created `src/utils/variableUtils/index.ts` for variable formatting utilities
   - Created `src/utils/general/index.ts` for general utility functions

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Update VisualEditor Component**
   - The main VisualEditor component still needs to be updated to use the extracted components, types, and utilities
   - We need to remove the local declarations that conflict with the imported ones
   - We need to update the imports in the VisualEditor component

2. **Testing**
   - Test the refactored code to ensure it works as expected
   - Fix any issues that arise during testing

## Next Steps

1. Create a new version of the VisualEditor component that uses the extracted components, types, and utilities
2. Gradually replace sections of the original VisualEditor component with the refactored code
3. Test each section as it's refactored to ensure it works as expected

## Challenges

The main challenge is that the original VisualEditor component has many local declarations that conflict with the imported ones. We need to carefully refactor each section to ensure that the functionality is preserved while using the extracted components, types, and utilities.
